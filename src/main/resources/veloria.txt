Veloria – The Land Beyond the Horizon
Veloria is a hidden realm, lying just beyond the edges of known maps. Shrouded in mist and mystery, it is a land reminiscent of medieval European folklore, yet infused with a unique magic all its own. Veloria’s landscapes evoke memories of the rugged highlands of Scotland, the lush forests of France, and the grand, wind-swept cliffs of Ireland.

Key Features of Veloria:

The Silverwood Forest: A vast, ancient forest where the trees are said to be older than any written history. The leaves shimmer with a silvery hue, particularly at dusk. Deep within the forest lies the Cairn of Eld, an ancient stone circle that serves as a portal for those who seek knowledge of the past.

The Stormveil Coast: A coastline of dramatic cliffs and dark, swirling seas, reminiscent of the Cornish or Irish coasts. Ships that venture too far into these waters rarely return, but local legends speak of lost sailors who’ve found a hidden island filled with untold treasures.

The Citadel of Auris: Perched high upon a hill, overlooking the surrounding valleys, this grand citadel is the heart of Veloria’s political and spiritual life. Its spires and ramparts resemble those of medieval European castles, and it is said to be home to an order of knights dedicated to preserving the realm’s ancient secrets.

The Vale of Echoes: A serene, lush valley surrounded by rolling hills and wildflowers. The air here is filled with the haunting sound of ancient songs, carried by the wind. It is a place of reflection and peace, where many come to meditate on life’s mysteries. The Spring of Selene, a natural well at the valley’s heart, is believed to offer visions to those pure of heart.

The Midnight Abbey: This ancient monastery, with Gothic architecture reminiscent of the grand cathedrals of Western Europe, is said to hold powerful relics from Veloria’s early history. The monks who reside here practice a form of mysticism, blending herbal healing with star-gazing. The abbey’s bells, when they ring at midnight, are believed to summon protective spirits.

The Town of Greystone: A bustling village on the banks of the Velor River, known for its cobbled streets and medieval-style stone houses. Greystone hosts weekly markets that draw travelers from all over Veloria, with vendors selling everything from rare herbs to enchanted artifacts. The annual Festival of Light, held in the town square, celebrates the victory of light over darkness with lanterns and fireworks, much like the festivals of Western Europe.
